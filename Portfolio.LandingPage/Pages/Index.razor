            I am a senior software engineer with over 20 years experience creating software solutions on Windows 
            and web platforms in agile and team-driven environments. I absolutely thrive on teams where continued 
            education and collaboration are embraced.
            <br/><br/>

            I love learning new things, and improving myself both professionally and personally. 
            <br/><br/>

            In my spare time, I enjoy coaching youth soccer, working on personal projects, playing video games, and 
            watching horror movies.
